## Why... What ?!
I like to share things with other developers from snippets of code and tutorials to advices...
This repository is a new way for me to share with you a selection of articles and/or books I found inspiring or have changed the vision I had of Web Development.

It will always evolve and I hope its content will be as interesting for you as it was for me.
Feel free to fork it and complete this exhaustive list with your own sources.

I wish you an interesting reading !
